                <p>
                    Hello, I am Brennen, a 15 year old self-taught developer from Creemore, Ontario with a passion for cybersecurity and authorized penetration testing. Since I started coding in 2019, I have been dedicated to understanding how systems work and evaluating how to tear them apart and get them to do unintended things! <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the years of programming, I have honed my skills in many modern languages such as Python, Javascript, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Kotlin, and Rust. In recent years, I have spent my time building tools for ethical hacking and penetration testing along with develoing secure solutions for clients to feel safe and secure online.<br>
                    <br>
                    In my time as a developer I have had a few business ventures as well! I started off selling scripts for some games in 2020 which automated very simple yet tedious tasks. In June 2023, I founded my marketplace, Conatus. Conatus was a marketplace for developers to sell their code without the worry for stealing as I would personally secure the code with a self-made obfuscation technique.<br>
                    <br>
                    Around the time I started Conatus Marketplace, I also started providing authorized Penetration Testing services where I would try to hack into client-side applications and provide feedback and support on how to improve security.
